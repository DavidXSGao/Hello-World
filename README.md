Hello World
______________
HELLO WORLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD! This is great! I love learning new programs. If you have somehow stumbled onto my GitHub, then I must have peeked your interests. Currently I have only uploaded my class assignments, labs and notes, but I have some interesting ideas I hope to get started. I will start attending Hackathons and learn more things to make this repository much more abundant. Hopefully I can add some unique app designs to show off my programming skills. I will end my introduction here, however feel free to contact me at any time. I absolutely love meeting new people and engaging in interesting conversations about anything.
